<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Veronika, and I am currently taking a web developer course. Exploring the world of coding and building websites has opened up a completely new perspective for me. 
I enjoy the process of learning step by step, from writing simple lines of HTML to creating more complex and interactive projects.</p>

<p>What I like most about web development is how creative and logical it can be at the same time. On the one hand, I get to design layouts and think about how users interact with a page.
On the other hand, I dive into problem-solving with code, which constantly challenges me and keeps me motivated.</p>

<p>This journey has only just begun, but I already see myself growing with every lesson. Iâ€™m excited about the opportunities this path can bring and look forward to turning my passion into a career in the tech industry.</p>
